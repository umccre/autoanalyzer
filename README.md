## Overview

Welcome to the Automated Survey Analyzer! This tool is designed to quickly process and analyze survey data (or similar datasets), providing:

- Frequencies
- Percentages
- Basic summary statistics

It‚Äôs ideal for simple analyses of **one-time surveys**, but also supports **pre-post surveys** and **multi-time-point surveys**‚Äîas long as each individual assessment is recorded on a separate line. For longitudinal analyses, be sure to include a variable that identifies the time point.
